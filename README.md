# Water-Consumption-and-Leakage-Detection
Leakage prevention and breaks identification in water distribution networks are fundamental for an adequate use of natural resources. We have tried to address this problem using 
advance technology of wireless communication. The first part is based on the flow rate detection and identifying the leakage. We have got a mechanical approach of this problem with
the use of motors and pipe. And the second part is based on informing the house owner about the leakage and flow rate of water in the pipe. The aim is to use Arduino 
microcontroller to design and build a water leakage detection & wireless control system, that enabled us to send information fast to user's GSM mobile device using SMS and also
activate - deactivate system by SMS, which provides the user with new features such as water leakage detection and water level control in tank by mobile application.
